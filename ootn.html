			The Dartmouth Conference of 1956 was organized by 
			Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy and two senior scientists:
			Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester of IBM. The proposal
			for the conference included this assertion: "every aspect
			of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be 
			so precisely described that a machine can be made to 
			simulate it". The participants included Ray
			Solomonoff, Oliver Selfridge, Trenchard More, Arthur
			Samuel, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, all 
			of whom would create important programs during the 
			first decades of AI research. At the conference 
			Newell and Simon debuted the "Logic Theorist" and McCarthy 
			persuaded the attendees to accept "Artificial Intelligence" 
			as the name of the field. The 1956 Dartmouth conference 
			was the moment that AI gained its name, its mission, its 
			first success and its major players, and is widely 
			considered the birth of AI.<br/>
