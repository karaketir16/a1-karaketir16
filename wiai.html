			What is Artificial Intelligence?

		<p>
			<q>
		
				Artificial intelligence (AI, also machine intelligence, MI)
				is apparently intelligent behaviour by machines, rather than 
				the natural intelligence (NI) of humans and other animals. 
				In computer science AI research is defined as the study of 
				"intelligent agents": any device that perceives its 
				environment and takes actions that maximize its chance 
				of success at some goal. Colloquially, the term 
				"artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine 
				mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with 
				other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
