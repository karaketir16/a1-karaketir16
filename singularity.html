			<h2>What is Singulartiy?</h2>
		&emsp;<q>The singularity is the hypothesis that the invention of 
		artificial superintelligence will abruptly trigger runaway 
		technological growth, resulting in unfathomable changes to 
		human civilization. According to this hypothesis, an upgradable
		intelligent agent (such as a computer running software-based 
		artificial general intelligence) would enter a "runaway reaction"
		of self-improvement cycles, with each new and more intelligent
		generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an 
		intelligence explosion and resulting in a powerful 
		superintelligence that would, qualitatively, far surpass all
		human intelligence. John von Neumann first used the term 
		"singularity" (c. 1950s), in the context of technological 
		progress causing accelerating change: "The accelerating 
		progress of technology and changes in the mode of human 
		life, give the appearance of approaching some essential 
		singularity in the history of the race beyond which human 
		affairs, as we know them, could not continue". Subsequent 
		authors have echoed this viewpoint. I. J. Good's "intelligence 
		explosion" model predicts that a future superintelligence will 
		trigger a singularity. Emeritus professor of computer science at
		San Diego State University and science fiction author Vernor 
		Vinge said in his 1993 essay The Coming Technological 
		Singularity that this would signal the end of the human era, as 
		the new superintelligence would continue to upgrade itself and 
		would advance technologically at an incomprehensible rate.</q>

			<h2>Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics</h2>
			
		&emsp;<q>Science-fiction author Isaac Asimov is often given credit for 
		being the first person to use the term robotics in a short 
		story composed in the 1940s. In the story, Asimov suggested 
		three principles to guide the behavior of robots and smart 
		machines. Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, as they are called, 
		have survived to the present:
		<ol>
			<li>Robots must never harm human beings or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. </li>
			<li>Robots must follow instructions from humans without violating rule 1. </li>
			<li>Robots must protect themselves without violating the other rules.</li>
		</ol>
