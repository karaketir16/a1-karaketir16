			Artificial Intelligence
		</h1>
		<p>
			Artificial intelligence (AI, also machine intelligence, MI)
			is apparently intelligent behaviour by machines, rather than 
			the natural intelligence (NI) of humans and other animals. 
			In computer science AI research is defined as the study of 
			"intelligent agents": any device that perceives its 
			environment and takes actions that maximize its chance 
			of success at some goal. Colloquially, the term 
			"artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine 
			mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with 
			other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".*
