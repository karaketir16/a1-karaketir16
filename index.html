				<h4>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h4>
					&emsp;<q style="background-color: white;">
						
						Artificial intelligence (AI, also machine intelligence, MI)
						is apparently intelligent behaviour by machines, rather than 
						the natural intelligence (NI) of humans and other animals. 
						In computer science AI research is defined as the study of 
						"intelligent agents": any device that perceives its 
						environment and takes actions that maximize its chance 
						of success at some goal. Colloquially, the term 
						"artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine 
						mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with 
						other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".

						<h4>Origin of the name</h4>
					&emsp;<q style="background-color: white;">
						The Dartmouth Conference of 1956 was organized by 
						Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy and two senior scientists:
						Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester of IBM. The proposal
						for the conference included this assertion: "every aspect
						of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be 
						so precisely described that a machine can be made to 
						simulate it". The participants included Ray
						Solomonoff, Oliver Selfridge, Trenchard More, Arthur
						Samuel, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, all 
						of whom would create important programs during the 
						first decades of AI research. At the conference 
						Newell and Simon debuted the "Logic Theorist" and McCarthy 
						persuaded the attendees to accept "Artificial Intelligence" 
						as the name of the field. The 1956 Dartmouth conference 
						was the moment that AI gained its name, its mission, its 
						first success and its major players, and is widely 
						considered the birth of AI.

					&emsp;Even you are not aware, Artificial Intelligence is 
					everywhere in your life. When you make a search on 
					a search engine, AI decides results (and advertisements)
					 that you see. When you check your email, you donâ€™t see 
					 spams thanks for AI. When you want to buy  a book or 
					 watch a movie, AI give you advices. Whenever you use
					  a computer, AI is probably somewhere.

				<h2>Some exapmles Artificial Intelligence in use</h2>
				<dl style="background-color: white;">
					<dt><strong>Video Games</strong></dt>
					<dd>
						I sure that you have played a game on 
						computer or mobile phone. Game programmers are
						able to create enemy against you using AI.
					</dd>
					<dt><strong>Security</strong></dt>
					<dd>
						Almost everybody have some images or anything 
						else that they want not to be seen by other people.
						Encryption technologies are more advanced than old
						thanks to AI.
					</dd>
					<dt><strong>Medicine</strong></dt>
					<dd>
						We all know that we are mortal, and likely we will
						die because of a disease. AI is used to develop 
						threatment for diseases for long lifetime.						  
					</dd>
					<dt><strong>Search Engines</strong></dt>
					<dd>
						Did you heard "Google"? Google is the most used
						search engine that provide us searching on web.
						Google use AI to decide which result should be 
						shown.

					&emsp;Everything seems to be good. AI is helpful for human
					benig, isn't it? However, there are somebody thinking that
					AI is dangerous for us because it will be clever than
					human, and it will rule us. Someone belive that when 
					AI is clever than human, it will continue to help us.
					Singularity is a time when Artificial Intelligence 
					became clever than human. To get more information
